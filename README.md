## Caching

The objective of this project is to implement different caching algorithms and gain an understanding of how caching systems work. Caching involves storing copies of frequently accessed data in a faster but smaller memory space to improve access times.

### Tasks

0. Basic dictionary
1. FIFO caching
2. LIFO Caching
3. LRU Caching
4. MRU Caching

## Personal data

This project aims to implement secure practices for managing personal data, particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The objectives are to understand PII, apply log filtering to obfuscate PII fields, securely encrypt passwords, and authenticate to a database using environment variables.

### Tasks

0. Regex-ing
1. Log formatter
2. Create logger
3. Connect to secure database
4. Read and filter data
5. Encrypting passwords
6. Check valid password

## Basic authentication

This project seeks to give practical experience in comprehending and implementing Basic Authentication in a straightforward API.

### Tasks

0. Simple-basic-API
1. Error handler: Unauthorized
2. Error handler: Forbidden
3. Auth class
4. Define which routes don't need authentication
5. Request validation!
6. Basic auth
7. Basic - Base64 part
8. Basic - Base64 decode
9. Basic - User credentials
10. Basic - User object
11. Basic - Overload current_user - and BOOM!

## Session authentication

This project is designed to offer practical experience in implementing Session Authentication, a widely-used method for authenticating users in web applications. Instead of utilizing established modules or frameworks like Flask-HTTPAuth, the focus is on grasping the underlying principles and processes involved in Session Authentication by constructing it from zero.

### Tasks

0. Et moi et moi et moi!
1. Empty session
2. Create a session
3. User ID for Session ID
4. Session cookie
5. Before request
6. Use Session ID for identifying a User
7. New view for Session Authentication
8. Logout
